- LUA dumper code Improvements   : BodNJenie ( https://github.com/bodnjenie14/ )

This Lua script was based on and improved from the Lua dump code shared by Lebta2, and was dumped in-game at runtime using our own PHA Modded clients.

The Lua dumper code has also been further improved by BodNJenie, making it work better.

The source of the Lua script is also posted as output by a Lua decompiler improved by zhm86.

[ iw8+ Demonware Modded Clients ]


The modding community I currently belong to, commonly known as "iw8-bodnjenie", focuses on MW19 and is developing clients for newer CoD games since then that use the Demonware Emulator.


With the implementation of DWEmu, CoD can emulate a complete online environment, allowing you to play the online experience of that time.

In addition, the servers are separate from the official CoD servers and use our own DW servers, so there is no risk to your CoD account, allowing you to enjoy multiplayer with your friends with peace of mind.


Currently, iw8-bod supports MW2019 versions 1.38 / 1.44 / 1.57 / 1.63 and CoDV. 

We are committed to continuing development so that we can make modded clients for many more versions and game titles playable.


iw8-bod is intended as a free release.

We welcome any willing engineers with coding or reverse engineering skills who want to help with client development!


If you're interested in DWEmu modded clients for recent Call of Duty games from MW2019 onwards, please join the Discord server below. 

We look forward to seeing you!
